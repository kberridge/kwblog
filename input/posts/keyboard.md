I have become a keyboard nerd, apparently.  Not that I [wasn't already](https://kevin-berridge.blogspot.com/2007/10/tools-of-trade-keyboard.html), [I guess](https://kevin-berridge.blogspot.com/2007/11/keyboard-follow-up.html), but I've just taken it to a different level.  What happened is one of my friends and coworkers recently built a mechanical keyboard, which then flaked out due to cheap parts, so he bought a Vortex Pok3r 60% Mechanical board.

If I was aware of boards like this before, I'd never taken them seriously.  But when my friend got into it I took notice.  And, wow, there's a whole freaking world out there!

Turns out, there's a bunch of dimensions to keyboards these days, each rich with options:
  
- Keyboard layout: which includes how many keys and where they're placed
- Mechanical (or pseudo mechanical) Switches: which mostly determines how pressing a key feels
- Keycaps: which also affects the feel, but is mostly about aesthetics
- Programmability: custom key mappings, on different layers (like while FN is held down), and macros (one key maps to a whole sequence of key presses)

When I got into this I was on my second Microsoft Natural Erognomic Keyboard 4000, which I have always loved.  It is comfortable.  But mine was getting old, and typing on it was starting to feel more like fight with it.  I don't know why exactly, perhaps the membrane is starting to wear in ways that just make the key presses feel unreliable, which has led me to really pound the crap out of the keys to make sure I'm being heard.

As I started learning about this stuff I quickly realized it was going to require some hands on experience so after getting an initial sense of what to expect, I went to MicroCenter and I came home with three boards to try:

  - Logitech Pro
  - Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition
  - Cooler Master MK730

I decided to start out with the "10-key less" layout, which is a regular keyboard layout minus the number pad.  Starting here meant I could actually try some boards at big box stores.
