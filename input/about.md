Title: About Me
---
Hi.  My name is Kevin Berridge.  I work at Matrix Pointe Software, and have done so since 2001!  My main experience has been with C# and SQL Server, but I've also worked with F#, PowerShell, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Ruby.  As Manager of Software Engineering, I've been focused on building quality software products, inside and out.  My main emphasis is on delivering quality code and usable applications using exciting tools and modern practices.  I love learning about what makes us tick and what influences how we do development today.  When I’m not hacking I’m probably playing jazz trombone or out for a run.

I started blogging on April 4 2007 on [my old blog hosted on blogger](http://kevin-berridge.blogspot.com).  I built this new blog in January 2018 to see if it would re-energize me to blog more.
