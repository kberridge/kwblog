title: About Me
---
Hi! I'm Kevin Berridge, and I've been building software at Matrix Pointe Software since 2001! As Director of Software Engineering, I focus on creating high-quality, user-friendly applications using exciting tools and modern practices. My core experience is in C#, SQL Server, TypeScript, React, and PowerShell, but I've also dabbled in F# and Ruby. I'm always eager to explore new tools and practices that improve how we develop software. Outside work I enjoy a good hobby including: playing trombone or piano, hitting the trails for a run, exploring new whiskeys, traveling, and reading.

I started blogging on April 4 2007 on [my old blog hosted on blogger](http://kevin-berridge.blogspot.com).  I built this new blog in January 2018.
